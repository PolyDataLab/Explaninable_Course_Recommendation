{"course_idx2":79,"name":"Alpine skiing","mode":"autonomous","about":"&nbsp;Skiing originated from the practice of human beings conquering nature. The earliest skiing activities were people using snow as a means of walking, hunting, transportation, migration, warfare, etc. It started around 8000 BC. With the changes of the times, the practical value of skiing has gradually decreased, but because it is closer to nature and life, it is widely accepted by people. Today, skiing has become one of the most popular leisure sports in winter. Alpine skiing was developed on the basis of cross-country skiing. Originating from the Alps in Europe, it is called Alpine skiing. It is a snow sport that uses skis and ski poles as the main equipment to perform turns and downhill on specially designed routes on the mountain. In 1721, a formal skiing organization was established in the Norwegian army. Twelve years later, general skiing skills became one of the necessary skills for men. In the early army, soldiers usually tied leather on the heels of their shoes. This was a primitive braking device to prevent their skis from falling off when going downhill. However, such binding is sometimes too loose to ensure control of the skis. Therefore, a separate, reliable ski pole emerges as the times require. It can play a braking role on downhill sections and can be used as a brake on flat sections. Accelerator for increased speed. From 1733 to 1917, Norway published the earliest ski books, established the earliest ski club and the first ski team. In the late 1920s, alpine skiing competitions further increased, especially large-scale competitions. At this time, alpine skiing was well-established both in terms of organization and rules. With the development of international events such as the World Championships and World Cup, alpine skiing has become popular all over the world. "}

{"course_idx2":112,"name":"Social statistical analysis based on R language","mode":"autonomous","about":"Statistics is the lingua franca of modern science and an indispensable tool for modern research. The combination of social science and classical statistical principles has formed a methodological system that uses statistical measurement systems to study human behavior in social environments. This system is not limited to esoteric numbers, tables and formulas, but is also a way of logical thinking; it provides researchers with not only the basic skills of collecting, analyzing, and understanding data, but also a science from evidence to conclusion. inference process. Statistical analysis can be divided into two parts: exploratory data analysis and inferential statistical methods. Probability theory is the bridge connecting the two. This course will use the powerful functions brought by the open source statistical software R language to introduce the necessary skills for exploring data. Next, we will explain the core theories of statistics such as sampling distribution, estimation, and hypothesis testing. Finally, we will discuss the application of advanced statistical methods such as multiple regression, logistic regression, and multilevel models in social sciences based on research examples from sociology, psychology, education and other disciplines. Even if you have had difficulty learning mathematics in the past, it does not mean that you will be at a disadvantage in this class. We believe that the training of logical thinking is more important than calculation ability. By the end of the course, you will have a better sense of how to extract effective information from complicated data; statistical analysis in other people's research will no longer be a restricted area for you to read; you will learn how to be a consumer of statistical principles and apply statistical thinking to Apply it to your own research.

Whether it is ancient society or modern society, they are closely related to human thought.

The principle of teleology; 2. The principle of goodness above all else; 3. The principle of giving priority to responsibility and obedience; 4. Rule The principle of legitimacy comes from a transcendent person outside of people; fifth, the principle of prioritizing the collective over the individual. These principles are implemented and implemented by converting them into responsibility principles. Therefore, ancient society first stipulated the relationship between people based on the principle of responsibility, and used this to construct the order of the world.Through the deep awareness and systematic demonstration of human individual freedom, the \"Enlightenment\" established a series of basic principles for modern society that are different from the principles of ancient society: 1. The principle of freedom first; 2. The principle of individual before collective; 3. Rights and The principle of parallel responsibilities; 4. The legitimacy of rule comes from the principle of authorization and recognition by the ruled. These principles can be summarized as the principle of rights. Modern society uses the principle of rights to construct the human order.This course will demonstrate these themes by discussing the following question: How did human thought establish the basic principles that formed the basis of order for ancient societies?

I combine my professional background in information science and my experience in innovative education to combine intelligent technology with innovation and entrepreneurship. In the course, we will discuss how to carry out innovation and entrepreneurship in the context of the advent of the intelligent era, and how to integrate artificial intelligence technology into various industries. The goal of the course is to enable more people to benefit from technological innovation and innovation and entrepreneurship. We summarize the course content into a model, with two key points and three parts. We propose an entrepreneurial capability model in the intelligent era. This capability model has five levels in total. The first level is the ability of self-awareness, including the clarification of self-values, the exploration of the meaning of life, and the clarification of vision and goals. This is the first ability. The second ability is innovation ability. Specifically, it is the combination of innovative mental models and innovative thinking methods; the third ability is technical ability, which means understanding computational thinking and the ability to use intelligent technology to design products. The fourth ability refers to business ability, including management ability, market and channel ability, capital and industry experience, and the fifth ability is the ability to work in a team. Therefore, our courses have two focuses. The first focus is the cultivation of innovation and entrepreneurship capabilities. Our courses specifically set up innovative ability training modules to improve innovation capabilities through practical training methods. Specifically, it is to improve innovation capabilities through the training of innovative mental models and innovative ways of thinking. For entrepreneurship, we will take you to observe the whole process of entrepreneurship, so as to tell you the truth about entrepreneurship. At the same time, it guides everyone to think about whether they are suitable for starting a business. We can regard this part of the content as a general course on innovation and entrepreneurship, which is suitable for all students to learn, and this part of the content does not require any knowledge background in other disciplines. The second focus is technological innovation in the intelligent era. We will discuss how to use intelligent technology to carry our innovation and entrepreneurship practices, and how to integrate artificial intelligence technology into the industry. This part is mainly from the perspective of technological innovation. For example, we will talk about computational thinking, we will talk about machine learning, we will talk about data technology and Internet technology, and we will talk about how intelligent technology is implemented in various industries.

Whether it is ancient society or modern society, they are closely related to human thought.

The principle of teleology; 2. The principle of goodness above all else; 3. The principle of giving priority to responsibility and obedience; 4. Rule The principle of legitimacy comes from a transcendent person outside of people; fifth, the principle of prioritizing the collective over the individual. These principles are implemented and implemented by converting them into responsibility principles. Therefore, ancient society first stipulated the relationship between people based on the principle of responsibility, and used this to construct the order of the world.Through the deep awareness and systematic demonstration of human individual freedom, the \"Enlightenment\" established a series of basic principles for modern society that are different from the principles of ancient society: 1. The principle of freedom first; 2. The principle of individual before collective; 3. Rights and The principle of parallel responsibilities; 4. The legitimacy of rule comes from the principle of authorization and recognition by the ruled. These principles can be summarized as the principle of rights. Modern society uses the principle of rights to construct the human order.This course will demonstrate these themes by discussing the following question: How did human thought establish the basic principles that formed the basis of order for ancient societies?

{"course_idx2":506,"name":"Innovative land redevelopment: land preparation","mode":"autonomous","about":"This course explores and introduces the process of planning and implementing land preparation in the context of a developing country.Land preparation is a land acquisition method that provides an alternative to mandatory government purchases (often called eminent domain) and voluntary market transactions. During the land preparation process, public or private agencies invite landowners to become stakeholders in a redevelopment project and contribute their land as investment capital to the project. In return, upon completion of the project, each landowner will receive a parcel of land of at least equal value adjacent to the original site. Once all properties in the area have been acquired, the combined lands will be subdivided to make room for road widening and other local infrastructure.Traditional methods of land acquisition often give rise to various conflicts. Through this course, practitioners can gain an understanding of land preparation as an alternative way to achieve urbanization in developing countries and add another viable tool option to their problem solving.Land preparation has demonstrated several advantages, including low initial capital requirements for land acquisition, effectiveness in dissuading resisters, and reduction in large-scale relocation of existing residents. If land preparation is carried out at the right time and place, this approach can provide fewer obstacles to land redevelopment in countries with rapid urbanization.The assessment methods for this course are all multiple-choice questions, divided into single-choice questions and multiple-choice questions, with a total of 18 questions."}
